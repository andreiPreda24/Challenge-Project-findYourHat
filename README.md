# Challange Project: Find Your Hat

## Description:
In this project I've tried to create an interactive terminal mini-game. The sole purpose is to find the 'hat' represented by '^', but to get there, the user must make its way through a generated field.

### Symbols and what they represent:
1. '*' = player / player path
2. '^' = hat (win condition)
3. 'O' = hole (loss condition)
4. '░' = field

## How to play:

Game starts and the player * is always spawned on top-left of the field. The hat '^' will spawn randomly in the field as well as the holes 'O'.
<br>
Write the following words in terminal to move through the field '░': 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right'.
<br>
Win condition: '*' gets to hat '^'
<br>
Loss condition: * walks in O or walks out of the  '░' area
